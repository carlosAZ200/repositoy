I have spent holidays in Salamina, it has passed too many years 
since then, have you ever travelled to Salamina? it's a beautiful place. 
I remember that we chose travel
with my five dogs, that they have never been out of home.
My mother has lived in Salamina, but i did't know Salamina.
during this holidays my father has been lost his watch and
the worst of it, one of my dogs has been lost,
we have decided never again traveling with my dogs, the 
good part of this is that i have seen my mother's land and 
i have seen my mother's family, but I haven't traveled since then.
